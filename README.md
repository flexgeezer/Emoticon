Emotion Recognition Software with UI

Detects 4 Emotions: Happy, Angry, Sad, Confused

Features two modes: Diagnosis & Live.

Diagnosis Mode: Evaluates user emotion over a minute, generating a report with a graph, the most prominent emotion emoji, editable comments, and a Report History window to access all previous reports. 

Live Mode: Displays an emoji of the average emotion with a face cam on screen, updating in real-time based on detected emotion.

Both modes can be stopped by pressing ESC when cam is on, however a report will still be generated during diagnosis mode

Supports non-Keras TensorFlow models that use Supervised Learning.
Directories of most folders and external files must be changed for your device.
